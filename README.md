# Recognition-of-Emotions-by-Analysis-of-Facial-Expressions

## Project description :

In this project, I developed an image classification model to distinguish six (or seven) emotions: joy, surprise,
fear, anger, disgust and sadness (a seventh emotion, contempt or neutral, is sometimes added). The dataset used will be FER 2013 composed of 7178 images.

## Tasks :

1. Data mining
2. Data preparation: Images must be preprocessed,
resized and normalized to be suitable for training a classification model. Students will also need to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Model creation: design and train an image classification model using knowledge transfer from MobileNet pre-trained models.
4. Data Augmentation.
5. Model training.
6. Validation and optimization.
